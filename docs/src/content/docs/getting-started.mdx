This guide will help you get started with Bazelle quickly.

## Prerequisites

- [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) 7.0 or later (Bazelisk recommended)
- A project with source files in supported languages

## Quick Start

<Steps>

1. **Initialize your project**

   If you're starting a new Bazel project or don't have Gazelle configured yet:

   ```bash
   bazelle init
   ```

   This will:
   - Detect languages used in your project
   - Create `MODULE.bazel` with required dependencies
   - Create `BUILD.bazel` with gazelle targets

2. **Generate BUILD files**

   Run Bazelle to generate BUILD files for your entire project:

   ```bash
   bazelle update
   ```

3. **Verify the results**

   Check that your BUILD files are correct:

   ```bash
   bazel build //...
   ```

</Steps>

## Using with Bazel

If you prefer to run Bazelle through Bazel, you can use the gazelle target:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="From Source">
    ```bash
    # Build the bazelle binary
    bazel build //cmd/bazelle

    # Run on your project
    bazel run //cmd/bazelle -- update /path/to/your/project
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Gazelle Target">
    ```bash
    # If you have a gazelle target in your BUILD file
    bazel run //:gazelle
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Example Workflow

Here's a typical development workflow with Bazelle:

```bash
# Initial setup
bazelle init
bazelle update

# During development - use watch mode
bazelle watch

# In CI - verify BUILD files are up to date
bazelle update --check
```

## Next Steps

- Learn about [Installation](/bazelle/installation/) options
- Explore [Configuration](/bazelle/configuration/) options
- See [CLI Reference](/bazelle/cli/) for all commands
