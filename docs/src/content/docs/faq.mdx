Common questions about Bazelle and how it works.

## General

### What is the difference between Bazelle and Gazelle?

**Gazelle** is Bazel's official BUILD file generator, primarily focused on Go with plugin support for other languages.

**Bazelle** wraps Gazelle with multiple language extensions pre-configured and adds:
- Unified CLI with `init`, `update`, `fix`, and `watch` commands
- Incremental update mode for faster builds
- Custom extensions for Kotlin, Python, and Groovy
- Opinionated defaults (e.g., `import` naming convention)

### Which languages are supported?

| Language | Status | Enabled by Default |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Go | Gazelle core | Yes |
| Proto | Gazelle core | Yes |
| Kotlin | Own extension | No |
| Python | Own extension | No |
| C/C++ | gazelle_cc | No |
| Groovy | Own extension | No |

### Do I need to install Gazelle separately?

No. Bazelle includes Gazelle and all extensions in a single binary.

### Can I use Bazelle with an existing Gazelle setup?

Yes. Bazelle is compatible with existing Gazelle configurations. Your existing directives will work.

## Configuration

### How do I enable a language?

Add the appropriate directive to your root `BUILD.bazel`:

```python
# gazelle:kotlin_enabled true
# gazelle:python_enabled true
```

### Where should I put directives?

- **Root `BUILD.bazel`**: For project-wide settings
- **Subdirectory `BUILD.bazel`**: For directory-specific overrides

Directives are inherited by subdirectories.

### How do I exclude directories?

```python
# gazelle:exclude vendor
# gazelle:exclude node_modules
# gazelle:exclude testdata
```

### Can I use custom macros instead of the default rules?

Yes. Each language supports custom macro configuration:

```python
# Kotlin
# gazelle:kotlin_library_macro my_kt_library
# gazelle:kotlin_load //build:defs.bzl

# Python
# gazelle:python_library_macro my_py_library
# gazelle:python_load //build:defs.bzl
```

## CLI

### What's the difference between `update` and `fix`?

- **`update`**: Safe, additive changes only. Adds new rules, updates sources.
- **`fix`**: May make breaking changes. Can delete obsolete rules, rename targets.

Use `update` for regular development. Use `fix` when refactoring or cleaning up.

### How does incremental mode work?

Bazelle tracks file changes in `.bazelle/` directory. When you run `bazelle update --incremental`, it only updates directories with changed files.

```bash
# First run - full update, creates state
bazelle update

# Subsequent runs - only changed directories
bazelle update --incremental

# Force full update
bazelle update --force
```

### Can I use Bazelle in CI?

Yes. Use the `--check` flag to verify BUILD files are up to date:

```bash
bazelle update --check
```

This exits with code 1 if changes are needed, making it ideal for CI.

## Troubleshooting

### Why aren't my files being detected?

Check that:
1. The language is enabled (e.g., `# gazelle:kotlin_enabled true`)
2. Files are in the expected location (e.g., `src/main/kotlin` for Kotlin)
3. The directory isn't excluded

<Aside type="tip">
Run with verbose logging to debug: `bazelle -v 3 update`
</Aside>

### Why are dependencies wrong?

Bazelle generates dependencies based on imports in your source files. If dependencies are incorrect:

1. Check that imports are properly declared
2. Verify the resolver can find the target package
3. For external deps, ensure they're configured in `MODULE.bazel`
