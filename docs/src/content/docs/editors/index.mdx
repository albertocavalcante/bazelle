description: Integrate Bazelle with your favorite code editor
---

Bazelle provides editor integrations to streamline your Bazel development workflow. Instead of switching to the terminal to update BUILD files, you can run Bazelle commands directly from your editor.

## Available Integrations

| Editor | Status | Features |
|--------|--------|----------|
| [VS Code](/bazelle/editors/vscode/) | **Stable** | Full integration with commands, status bar, watch mode |
| Neovim | Planned | Coming soon |
| JetBrains | Planned | Coming soon |

## Why Use an Editor Integration?

- **Faster workflow**: Update BUILD files without leaving your editor
- **Visual feedback**: See Bazelle status in your status bar
- **Auto-update**: Optionally update BUILD files on save
- **Watch mode**: Automatically regenerate BUILD files when source files change
- **Starlark highlighting**: Syntax highlighting for BUILD files, `.bzl` files, and `MODULE.bazel`

## Getting Started

Choose your editor from the sidebar to get started with the integration.
