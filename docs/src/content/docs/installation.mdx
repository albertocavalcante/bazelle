## Installation Methods

### From Source (Recommended)

Build Bazelle directly from the source repository:

<Steps>

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/albertocavalcante/bazelle.git
   cd bazelle
   ```

2. **Build with Bazel**

   ```bash
   bazel build //cmd/bazelle
   ```

3. **Run or install**

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="Run directly">
       ```bash
       ./bazel-bin/cmd/bazelle/bazelle_/bazelle --help
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Copy to PATH">
       ```bash
       cp ./bazel-bin/cmd/bazelle/bazelle_/bazelle /usr/local/bin/bazelle
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

</Steps>

### Using Bazel Run

You can run Bazelle directly through Bazel without installing it:

```bash
# From the bazelle repository
bazel run //cmd/bazelle -- update /path/to/your/project

# Or use the wrapper target
bazel run //:gazelle
```

## Verifying Installation

Check that Bazelle is installed correctly:

```bash
bazelle version
```

You should see output like:

```
bazelle v0.1.0 (abc1234)
```

## Dependencies

Bazelle is a self-contained Go binary with all language extensions built-in. The only external requirements are:

- **Bazel 7.0+**: Required for running builds (Bazelisk recommended)
- **Go 1.21+**: Only needed if building from source

## Project Setup

After installing Bazelle, you can set up a new project:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Initialize (creates MODULE.bazel and BUILD.bazel if needed)
bazelle init

# Generate BUILD files
bazelle update
```

See [Configuration](/bazelle/configuration/) for details on customizing Bazelle behavior.

## Editor Integration

For the best development experience, install the Bazelle extension for your editor:

- **VS Code**: See the [VS Code Extension](/bazelle/editors/vscode/) documentation
- Run Bazelle commands from the Command Palette
- Status bar shows BUILD file status
- Watch mode for automatic updates
- Syntax highlighting for Starlark/BUILD files
