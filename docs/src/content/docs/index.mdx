## What is Bazelle?

Bazelle wraps [Bazel Gazelle](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/bazel-gazelle) with multiple language extensions pre-configured, so you don't have to set up complex toolchains and dependencies yourself.

**Two commands. That's it.**

```bash
bazelle init      # Set up your project
bazelle update    # Generate all BUILD files
```
