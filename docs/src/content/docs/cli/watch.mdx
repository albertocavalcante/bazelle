import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The `watch` command monitors your workspace for source file changes and automatically updates BUILD files when changes are detected. This provides a seamless development experience where BUILD files stay in sync with your code.

## Usage

```bash
bazelle watch [flags] [path]
```

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--debounce` | Debounce window in milliseconds (default: 500) |
| `--languages` | Only watch specific languages (comma-separated) |
| `--verbose` | Show file-level changes |
| `--json` | Stream JSON events (for tooling integration) |
| `--no-color` | Disable colored output |

## Examples

### Basic Watch

Start watching the current workspace:

```bash
bazelle watch
```

Example output:

```
bazelle: watching 1,247 files in /path/to/workspace
bazelle: languages: go, kotlin, python
bazelle: ready

[14:32:15] ~ src/auth/login.kt
[14:32:15] updating //src/auth:all...
[14:32:16] ✓ src/auth/BUILD.bazel updated

[14:35:42] + src/api/handler.go
[14:35:42] updating //src/api:all...
[14:35:43] ✓ src/api/BUILD.bazel updated
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop watching.

### Watch Specific Directory

Watch only a subdirectory:

```bash
bazelle watch ./src
```

### Filter Languages

Only watch specific languages:

```bash
bazelle watch --languages go,kotlin
```

### Verbose Mode

Show detailed file-level changes:

```bash
bazelle watch --verbose
```

### JSON Output

For integration with editors and tools:

```bash
bazelle watch --json
```

Example JSON events:

```json
{"type":"ready","files":1247,"languages":["go","kotlin","python"]}
{"type":"change","file":"src/auth/login.kt","action":"modified"}
{"type":"update","target":"//src/auth:all","status":"started"}
{"type":"update","target":"//src/auth:all","status":"completed","file":"src/auth/BUILD.bazel"}
```

### Debounce Configuration

Adjust the debounce window (useful for slow file systems or rapid edits):

```bash
# Longer debounce for slower systems
bazelle watch --debounce 1000

# Shorter debounce for faster feedback
bazelle watch --debounce 200
```

## How It Works

1. **Startup**: Scans the workspace and registers file watchers for source files
2. **Detection**: Uses OS file system events (fsnotify) to detect changes
3. **Debouncing**: Groups rapid changes within the debounce window
4. **Update**: Runs Gazelle on affected directories
5. **Output**: Reports which BUILD files were updated

## Ignored Files

Watch automatically ignores:

- `.git/` directory
- `bazel-*` directories (Bazel output)
- `.bazelle/` state directory
- Files matching `.gitignore` patterns
- Binary files and build artifacts

## Integration with Editors

### VS Code

Add to your tasks.json:

```json
{
  "label": "Bazelle Watch",
  "type": "shell",
  "command": "bazelle watch --json",
  "isBackground": true,
  "problemMatcher": []
}
```

### Terminal Multiplexer

Run watch in a split pane while developing:

```bash
# tmux example
tmux split-window -h 'bazelle watch'
```

## Graceful Shutdown

Watch handles signals gracefully:

- `Ctrl+C` (SIGINT): Clean shutdown
- `SIGTERM`: Clean shutdown
- `SIGHUP`: Clean shutdown (terminal closed)

<Aside type="tip">
Watch mode is ideal for local development. For CI, use `bazelle update --check` instead.
</Aside>

## Performance

Watch is optimized for large codebases:

- Only processes directories with actual changes
- Uses efficient file system watching (fsnotify)
- Debounces rapid changes to avoid redundant updates
- Filters irrelevant files at the OS level

## Limitations

- Does not track changes made by external tools that bypass file system events
- Some network file systems may not support file watching
- Very large workspaces (100k+ files) may need increased debounce times
